        <p class='font-weight-bold'> Frontend Features </p>
        <p>
            The user will encounter a login screen to login with their username and password in order to access 
            their chats. If they are new to the app, they will have to register to create an account. Once logging 
            in, the user will see a display of their chats with different users on the left side of their window in 
            a panel. When a user clicks on another user, their messages will appear. If they have never contacted 
            the other user before, their message screen will be blank. They will also be able to see which users 
            are online and offline, available or unavailable.

        <p>
            The server will have to authenticate the user or register the user. The server will send and 
            receive (display) messages from one user to another in order to make the communication actually happen.

        <p class='font-weight-bold'> Database Features </p>
        <p>
            The database will have to store the user’s information, username and password, so the user can login 
            and not have to re-register every time. The database will also have to store user-to-user messages in 
            order to have a conversation history.

        <h1> CSCI-4208 Final Project Proposal </h1>
        <h6> Posted April 2, 2021 </h6>
        <br>
        <p>
        Our proposed idea for a full stack app is creating a chat application. With the little amount of time we will have to 
        implement the idea, we decided this would be the best way to go. Chat applications are something that we use on a daily 
        basis, whether it be Discord, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc. They are an easy way to communicate with others remotely 
        and can be convenient, especially nowadays with Covid-19. Although there are many chat applications out there that do 
        many of the same things, we believe that user experience and user interface design are two major features to consider 
        when someone decides on which app they prefer. Our goal for our chat application is to fulfill these two features using 
        the knowledge we are learning in our Web Application course. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Abstract: As a team we will create a chat application. Similar to Discord and other applications, the app will solve 
            several issues. It will be the solution for students and friends to talk during the pandemic. This application will 
            also solve the hideous difficulty of finding groups a user would like to be a part of, may that be any topic such as 
            programming or video games. The audience for this app will gear towards groups of long time friends and students that 
            will need to connect with classmates and teachers as well as streamers/gamers. The features of this app will be as follows: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Messaging groups:</b> users can create groups and invite friends.</li>
            <li><b>Streaming:</b> users can stream videos of games or other topics with friends/classmates</li>
            <li><b>Friends list:</b> users can follow people and groups</li>
            <li><b>Online:</b> people will have the ability to choose if they want to be online, idle, or offline.</li>
        </ul>
